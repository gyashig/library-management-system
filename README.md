As a React developer, I worked on a library management system front end that included several key features and interfaces. Here are the five aspects I focused on:<br>
1- <b>Book Listing:</b> I implemented a reusable React component that rendered a dynamic list of books available in the library. Each book entry was represented by a separate React component that displayed relevant details such as title, author, and availability status. The book list component utilized React's virtual DOM rendering and state management to efficiently update and display the book data. :<br>

2- <b>Book Rating:</b> I integrated a rating system using React components and state management. Users could interact with the rating component to provide feedback on books based on their reading experience. The rating component would update its state based on user input and trigger appropriate React lifecycle methods to reflect the changes in real-time.:<br>

3- <b>Filtering and Sorting:</b> To enhance the usability of the book list, I implemented filtering and sorting functionality using React's state and props. Users could interact with filter and sort components, which triggered state changes in the parent component, causing the book list to re-render and display filtered and sorted results. React's component lifecycle methods, such as componentDidUpdate, were used to handle the updates efficiently. :<br>

4- <b>Admin Interface:</b> I developed a separate React interface specifically tailored for administrators. This interface utilized React Router to define different routes and components for managing the library. Admins could navigate to different pages/components to perform actions like adding new books, editing book details, and updating the availability status. React's component composition and state management were used to handle the various administrative functionalities. :<br>

5-<b>User Interface:</b> Alongside the admin interface, I created a user-friendly React interface for library patrons. The user interface included components for searching books, viewing book details, checking availability, and requesting book borrowing. React's state and props were leveraged to handle user interactions and maintain the application's dynamic behavior. React Router enabled seamless navigation between different pages/components within the user interface.:<br>

Additionally, the essential feature can be described as follows: <br>


6-<b>Issuing a Book:</b> Users could initiate a borrowing request by selecting an available book and filling out a React form with their name and contact information. On form submission, the data was sent to the backend through API calls, triggering updates to the book's status in the React component's state. React's data flow and lifecycle methods were used to ensure the UI reflected the updated book availability status and to notify the admin about the borrowing request. <br>
